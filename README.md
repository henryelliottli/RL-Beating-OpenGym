# RL-Beating-OpenGym

How to run:
Ensure all packages have been installed.


To train an image based model and output the metrics run `python main.py <Game Name>`  
  ex: `python main.py Breakout`  
  
Then once the model has been fully trained and saved run   
  `python test.py <Game Name>`  
in order to render the images and watch the model play the game.   
  
Lastly, given the trained model run TSNE by following the example in `example_tsne.ipynb` in the tsne folder
